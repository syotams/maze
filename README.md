## A small maze example with a resolver using DFS traversal written in Angular 1.5

Click a cell to mark it as occupied (obstacle), once finished click on start button on the left to mark it as a
starting point for the path resolver, then click on the end button to mark a cell as the end point of the path,
to resolve the path, click "go" and the algorithm will try to find a path from start to the end point.

The algorithm traverse over the matrix using a Depth First Search (DFS) to find a valid path but not the shortest
